# Marketing Project – ROMI & CAC

Marketing analytics case study focused on revenue impact and budget efficiency.  
Goal: measure ROMI, CAC and user lifetime metrics to improve marketing decisions and resource allocation.

### Context
Marketing teams often invest across multiple channels without knowing which sources actually generate profitable users.  
This project evaluates marketing performance and identifies where budget should be reduced, increased or maintained based on real business value contribution.

### Key Questions
- Which acquisition channels bring the most profitable users?
- What is the average CAC and how does it compare by channel?
- What is the ROMI by source?
- What channels should we stop funding or scale up?

### Methodology
- Python + Pandas for data wrangling
- Cohort analysis
- Funnel metrics
- ROMI + CAC estimation
- Business recommendations based on marginal ROI

### Result (summary)
We found acquisition sources with negative ROMI and significantly higher CAC, which allows the company to stop wasting budget and reallocate investment to channels with positive and scalable return.

### Tech
Python · Pandas · Matplotlib
